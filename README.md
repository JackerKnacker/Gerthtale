# Gerthtale - an RPG game inspired by Final Fantasy & Undertale

Downloading Instructions
-------------
1. Download all of the stuff in a ZIP folder.
2. Extract it all into a folder that you want the game to be in.
3. All images that are NOT in a folder must be placed in a separate folder called 'Pictures'.
*Sprites and maps should already be in their own respective folders.*
4. Convert all music from MP3 to WAV.
5. Gerthtale.java should now be runnable.
*You may have to remove the line "package Gerthtale;" from Gerthtale.java if you don't
have a package for the game.*
       
If you're updating Gerthtale.java, just upload your version of it to the master branch (which is this one) 
as well as any other classes you have added.
